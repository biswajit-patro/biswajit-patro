### Hii !ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ch Biswajit Patro 
## DATA IS EVERYTHING!!!
## I am currently serving as a BI Manager, specializing in a hybrid role that integrates the expertise of a Senior Data Scientist and Data Engineer at AFPL. In this capacity, I orchestrate data-driven strategies and engineer sophisticated solutions to drive business intelligence and analytical excellence.

My interest to solve real-time business challenges through historical data , inclined me to this data domain from finance domain. By using data analytics, data science, and AI tools i love to craft and resolve new business problems independently. So,I bring a unique blend of financial expertise and business acumen to the table.

I am happy to discuss new things related to this field and open for collaboration.
